# Action Required: Replace Mock Data with BetterAuth

Manual steps that must be completed by a human. These cannot be automated.

## Before Implementation

None required.

All dependencies are already in place (BetterAuth, PostgreSQL, Drizzle ORM).

## During Implementation

None required.

All tasks are automated through code changes and database migrations.

## After Implementation

- [ ] **Run migrations on production database** - The migration generated in Phase 1 must be applied to production database
- [ ] **Test with a real user account** - Create a new account and verify 5 credits are assigned
- [ ] **Verify data isolation** - Ensure users can only see their own data
